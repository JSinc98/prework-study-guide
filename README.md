# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website provides a place to store and review my notes from my prework of my coding bootcamp course, using HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

- I was motivated to learn the basics of website construction.
- I wanted to have somewhere to store my notes that I could access from any computer.
- It solves the problem of having my notes available in only one place. 
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript and how they work together to construct a website.
